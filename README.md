# Python Projects Collection

This repository is a collection of small Python projects I built while practicing and improving my programming skills.

The projects are a mix of:

- scripting utilities
- beginner–intermediate games
- number-guessing and logic games
- simple GUI apps
- mini automation scripts

Many of these projects are inspired by / based on the **Tech With Tim 9-hour Python projects compilation**, then customized and expanded as I learned.
